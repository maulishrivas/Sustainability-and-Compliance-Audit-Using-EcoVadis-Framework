# EcoVadis Sustainability Audit – Project Starter

This repository contains a **hands-on EcoVadis-style sustainability audit**. It mirrors your ISO/IEC 27001 internal audit project but focuses on the **EcoVadis four themes**: Environment, Labor & Human Rights, Ethics, and Sustainable Procurement.

## Files
- `EcoVadis_Audit_Checklist.xlsx` – Excel checklist with **status & risk drop-downs**, **auto-scoring**, and a **Scoring** sheet with charts.
- `EcoVadis_Audit_Report.md` – Report outline (Markdown) ready to export to PDF.
- `README_EcoVadis_Project.md` – This guide.

## Step By Step Use
1. **Open the Checklist** sheet and review each row.
2. For each requirement,I have set **Status** (Compliant / Partial / Non-compliant / Not Applicable) and **Risk** (High / Medium / Low / N/A).
3. The **Score** column auto-calculates (2/1/0). I added **Notes** and **Next Action**.
4. I logged into any issues in **Findings Register** with clear **Recommendation** and **Target Date**.
5. I checked the **Scoring** sheet to see **Compliance % by Theme** and the **Status Distribution** chart.
6. I exported your results into the `EcoVadis_Audit_Report.md` (then convert to PDF).

## Scoring Logic
- **Compliant = 2**, **Partial = 1**, **Non-compliant = 0**, **N/A = blank**.
- Compliance % per theme = `Scored Points / Max Points`.

## STAR sequence of Report
**Situation:** Built an EcoVadis-aligned sustainability audit to complement ISO/IEC 27001 work.  
**Task:** Create a practical **checklist + scoring + findings** system to assess a sample org.  
**Action:** Implemented **Excel** with validations, auto-scoring, charts; documented findings and report; wrote a README detailing method.  
**Result:** Produced a structured audit that identified key gaps in **supplier ESG assessment**, **anti-corruption training completion**, and **energy monitoring**, demonstrating **risk-based assessment** and multi-framework fluency (EcoVadis + ISO/SOC2/PCI).

## Evidence to be collected
- Environment: Carbon policy, GHG inventory, waste manifests, energy dashboards.  
- Labor & Human Rights: Equal opportunity policy, H&S training logs, whistleblowing channel evidence.  
- Ethics: Anti-corruption policy & LMS completion %; gifts & hospitality register; due diligence records.  
- Sustainable Procurement: Supplier Code of Conduct acknowledgments; ESG assessments; contract ESG clauses.
